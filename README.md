# ParkAlert Vision System

The ParkAlert Vision System is a sophisticated application designed to detect and classify vehicles in parking lots using real-time video streams. It leverages advanced computer vision techniques and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for efficient object detection.

## Features

- Real-time vehicle detection and classification.
- Parking spot management with drawing and undo capabilities.
- Integration with RTSP and HLS video streams.
- Visual overview of detected vehicles.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jackrvu/parkalert.git
   cd parkalert/vision
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. **YOLO Model Files:**

   Ensure you have the YOLO model files (`yolov8x.pt`) in the working directory. You can download them from the [Ultralytics YOLO repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

2. **Video Stream URL:**

   Update the `hls_url` variable in `main.py` with your RTSP or HLS stream URL:

   ```python
   hls_url = "http://localhost:8888/test/stream.m3u8"
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**

   Start the application by executing:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Drawing Parking Spots:**

   - Click on the video window to draw parking spots by selecting four points for each spot.
   - Press 's' to save the spots, 'u' to undo the last spot, and 'q' to quit the drawing mode.

3. **Vehicle Detection:**

   - The application will automatically detect and classify vehicles in the video stream.
   - Detected vehicles and their positions will be displayed in the overview window.

4. **Exiting the Application:**

   - Press 'q' in the main window to exit the application.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the video stream URL is correct and accessible.
- Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly.
- Check for any network issues that might affect video stream access.
