# Patent Downloader (sweet-case)

This folder contains a script to download patent data from the USPTO for a given company using Selenium and Chrome.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

   Navigate to this folder and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python download_patents.py "Company Name"
   ```
   Replace `Company Name` with the name of the company you want to search for (e.g., `Rice University`).

## Notes
- All files (including this README, requirements.txt, and the script) should remain in the `sweet-case` folder.
- The script will create a CSV file with the results in this folder.
- Make sure you have Google Chrome installed on your system.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `download_patents.py`
This script automates the process of downloading patent information from the USPTO website. It:
- Searches for patents containing "{company name}" in the title
- Collects patent IDs, names, and dates
- Exports the data to a CSV file named `{company name}_patents.csv`

### 2. `analyze_patents.py`
This script analyzes the collected patent data to:
- Calculate the average number of patents per year
- Identify the year with the most patents
- Generate visualizations of patent trends over time

## Setup Instructions

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 pandas webdriver-manager
```

3. Install Chrome browser if not already installed (required for Selenium)

## Usage

1. First, run the data collection script:
```bash
python welfare/sweet-case/download_patents.py
```
This will create a `ncr_patents.csv` file containing the patent data.

2. Then, run the analysis script:
```bash
python welfare/sweet-case/analyze_patents.py
```
This will generate analysis results and visualizations based on the collected data.

## Output Files

- `{company_name}_patents.csv`: Contains the raw patent data
- Analysis results will be displayed in the console
- Visualizations will be saved as image files (if implemented)

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Chrome browser
- Required Python packages:
  - selenium
  - beautifulsoup4
  - pandas
  - webdriver-manager

## Notes

- The scripts include appropriate delays to respect the USPTO website's rate limits
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection when running the download script
- The analysis script requires the CSV file generated by the download script to be present
